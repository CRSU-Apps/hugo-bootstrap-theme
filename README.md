## Bootstrap

Get started with Bootstrap

[Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)

[Install Bootstrap in your Node.js powered apps with the npm package](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/#npm)

## Requirements

The tools used are cross-platform and should work on Windows, MacOS and Linux. You will need the following tools to be downloaded and installed:

- [Hugo static site builder](https://github.com/goHugoio/Hugo/releases) - IMPORTANT: make sure you pick the extended version, Hugo_extended_0.xx.x_…

- [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/) - We use this to maintain project dependencies

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - This is optional, but highly recommended for version control and remote backups.

## Test your static site

Test if the site is working:

 hugo server -D --disableFastRender

This launches Hugo development server and you can see your website by opening http://localhost:1313.
